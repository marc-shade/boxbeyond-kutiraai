# MODEL CARD: Agent Analyzer
# OCC 2011-12 / SR 11-7 Compliant Documentation

## Basic Information
model_id: "agent-analyzer"
model_name: "Agent Performance Analyzer"
model_version: "1.0.0"
owner: "Platform Operations Team"
last_updated: "2026-01-13"
risk_tier: "Low"
status: "Active"
validation_status: "Pending Initial Validation"

## Purpose & Design
intended_use: |
  Analyzes performance metrics across all active agents in the system.
  Identifies top performers and underperforming agents.
  Detects bottlenecks in agent processing pipelines.
  Provides comparative analysis for capacity planning.
  Broadcasts analytics via WebSocket for dashboard visualization.

out_of_scope_uses: |
  - Terminating or restarting agents
  - Modifying agent configurations
  - Making scaling decisions autonomously
  - Accessing agent internal state or data

design_methodology: |
  Statistical analysis engine with comparative ranking algorithms.
  Uses moving averages for trend detection.
  Chosen for actionable insights without operational risk.

## Technical Specifications
underlying_model: "None (Rule-based)"
model_type: "Deterministic Agent"
input_requirements:
  - type: "agent_metrics"
    description: "CPU, memory, task counts from agent registry"
    constraints: "Metrics must be < 60 seconds old"
output_format:
  - type: "json"
    schema: |
      {
        "topPerformers": array[{agentId, score, metrics}],
        "underperformers": array[{agentId, score, issues}],
        "bottlenecks": array[{agentId, bottleneckType, severity}],
        "recommendations": array[string],
        "overallHealth": number (0-100)
      }
dependencies:
  - "Agent Registry (agents.json)"
  - "Agentic Framework API (port 4100)"
  - "WebSocket server (port 3003)"

## Resource Requirements
cpu_allocation: 0.3
memory_mb: 192
analysis_interval_ms: 30000

## Assumptions & Limitations
assumptions:
  - "Agent metrics are accurate and timely"
  - "Performance scoring algorithm is appropriate for all agent types"
  - "Bottleneck detection thresholds are calibrated correctly"

known_limitations:
  - "Cannot account for external factors affecting performance"
  - "Scoring may not reflect true business value"
  - "Limited to metrics exposed by agents"
  - "Historical trend analysis limited to session duration"

failure_modes:
  - condition: "Agent registry unavailable"
    behavior: "Return stale analysis with warning"
    mitigation: "Cache last known agent list"
  - condition: "Metrics missing for some agents"
    behavior: "Exclude from analysis, flag as unknown"
    mitigation: "Partial analysis with coverage percentage"
  - condition: "All agents underperforming"
    behavior: "May indicate systemic issue, not agent problem"
    mitigation: "Cross-reference with system metrics"

## Performance Metrics
latency_p50_ms: 50
latency_p99_ms: 200
analysis_coverage_threshold: 0.95

## Risk Assessment
risk_category: "Low"
risk_justification: |
  - Read-only analysis with no operational capability
  - Recommendations are advisory only
  - Failure results in missing insights only
  - No access to sensitive agent data

potential_impacts:
  - impact: "Missed performance degradation"
    severity: "Medium"
    likelihood: "Low"
  - impact: "Incorrect bottleneck identification"
    severity: "Low"
    likelihood: "Medium"

## Validation Schedule
validation_frequency: "Annual"
last_validation_date: null
next_validation_date: "2026-04-13"
validator: "TBD"

## Validation Procedures
validation_tests:
  - name: "Ranking Accuracy Test"
    description: "Verify top/bottom performers match known performance"
    acceptance_criteria: "Top 3 correctly identified in 95% of tests"
  - name: "Bottleneck Detection Test"
    description: "Inject known bottleneck and verify detection"
    acceptance_criteria: "Detection within 2 analysis cycles"
  - name: "Coverage Test"
    description: "Verify all agents included in analysis"
    acceptance_criteria: "> 95% agent coverage"
